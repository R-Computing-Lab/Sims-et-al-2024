by separating sources of variance. We also examined if women were more likely to be depressed than men. We hypothesized increased depression will lead to more crime in adolescents. We examined the correlations between the two variables. We also used classic regression analysis to examine the relationship. We used the discordant kin model to predict criminal behavior from depression using a within family analysis which includes within-family variance in the sibling differences.

CESD_7_1992

The CESD_7_1992 difference was significant t(2916)= 2.179, p=0.0294. A one unit increase in the average depression CESD_7_1992 predicted a .002 increase in average criminal behavior difference, controlling for all other variables in the model. The CESD_7 depression score did predict criminal behavior. This means that the difference was meaningful above or beyond the other sources of variance. Our hypothesis was supported.

# CESD_20_1992

The CESD_20 depression difference was not significant.. The CESD_20 depression score did not predict criminal behavior. This means that the difference was not meaningful above or beyond the other sources of variance. Our hypothesis was not supported. Increased depression did not lead to more crime in adolescents.
