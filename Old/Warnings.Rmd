#I can't figure out the +- not meanigful for factors. I did change the outcomes to the right ones- delin_mean not CESD. Would that affect it? If I take out race, the first two +- warnings go away. 

Warning in Ops.factor(IVi$predictor1, IVi$predictor2) :
  ‘-’ not meaningful for factors
Warning in Ops.factor(IVi$predictor1, IVi$predictor2) :

`{r predict delin_mean from dep chunk}
#I couldn't figure this one out- it didn't make any sense. It doesn't matter which file I run it in-simple or spsp or simple_explained, it always says invalid argument and never runs. I think it has something to do with the package itself.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
